Google Place API is used for auto fill location to enhance user experience. Users can sign up and sign in to their accounts using JWT token. Users can also retrieve their order history from MongoDB and create wishlists. Little features like showing the user that an item is out of stock or limiting users' quantity to cart enchance overall experience. ",

I also used Firebase to keep track of the movie data as well as store user accounts after they've sign up and sign in using FirebaseAuth. In hindesight, I should've made a clone of something less popular than Netflix because visitors to the site receive a phishing warning.",
